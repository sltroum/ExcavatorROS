# optoforce

ROS driver for the [Optoforce sensor](http://optoforce.com/3dsensor/).

## Optoforce models supported

- Single-channel 3 axis force sensor
- Multi-channel 3 axis force sensor (4 channels)
- Single-channel 6 axis force sensor

## Driver description

The driver relies on the pySerial library to get data from the sensors through USB. The module optoforce is completely independant from ROS and can be used as such.

The ROS node built with this driver publishes messages of type `geometry_msgs/WrenchStamped` for every sensor.

## Installation of udev rule
Why ? Thanks to this udev rule, the sensors' names will no longer depend on the order in which they are plugged in the computer. The names would look like `/dev/optoforce_ISE174`.

To do so, copy `optoforce.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`. Then, open this file and replace `PATH/TO` with the actual path to the `get_serial.py` file.

Also make sure that the file `src/optoforce/get_serial.py` has execution rights for all users.

Now, next time an optoforce sensor is plugged in, it should appear in `/dev/` as `optoforce_SERIAL` where `SERIAL` is the actual sensor's serial number.

> **Note:** The path to give to the optoforce node has to be adapted.


> **Note:** Should there be a problem getting the serial number, a random number will be used instead of the serial number.

## Quickstart

Have a look at `optoforce.launch` for the node's parameters and their values.

It also loads parameters from the `multi_channel_3_axis_generic_scale.yaml` file. They are ratios from raw data to Newton, as found in the sensor's sensitivity report. If you have a single channel force sensor, have a look at `single_channel_3_axis_generic_scale.yaml`.

### Shadow robot's hand

- `optoforce_hand.launch` start the optoforce node configured for the hand
- `rviz.launch` will start Rviz configured to display the hand
